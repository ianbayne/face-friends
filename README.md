One reason for this project was to get experience with:
- Using [Shrine] for file attachments
- Hosting files on AWS
- Polymorphic relationships
- The publish-subscribe pattern using [Wisper]
- At my [day job], we exclusively use [RSpec] for testing; I wanted to get experience with [minitest] as well
